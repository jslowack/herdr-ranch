# Herdr Ranch

![Herdr Ranch: issues, pull requests and your agents' questions next to your terminals](docs/images/social.png)

Three mods for the [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) desktop app. They show the work of the space you're in next to its terminals and agents. Plus a layout that gives each of them a button in the tab bar.

**It's opinionated.** It assumes code on GitHub, issues in Jira, Linear or GitHub, and agents working in their own worktrees; the mods only read, you act in the tools themselves. If you work differently, each mod installs on its own and its `RECIPE.md` lets your agent build a variant.

## Install

Tell your agent, in Herdr:

```text
Read ~/.config/herdr-app/AGENTS.md, then install everything from github.com/jslowack/herdr-ranch: the mods herdr-ranch-issues, herdr-ranch-prs and herdr-ranch-reviews (with its ranch-review CLI and skills), the mod-buttons layout, and their keys.json entries; then switch to the mod-buttons layout.
```

Or in a terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jslowack/herdr-ranch && cd herdr-ranch && ./install.sh --layout
herdr-app do layout.switch '{"name":"mod-buttons"}'
```

You get **Issues**, **PRs** and **Reviews** buttons next to Files and Changes.

**Needs:** [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) signed in, and `git`. Jira and Linear only for what you use; Node.js for Reviews. Tested on macOS; Linux and Windows follow their documented commands.

One mod at a time, keyboard shortcuts and updating: see [Install and update](docs/guide.md#install-and-update).

## Issues

![Issues: the list, an issue's page with Start agent, and the Start agent dialog](herdr-ranch-issues/preview.png)

The space's issues from Jira Cloud, Linear or GitHub. Each issue opens as a page like GitHub's. **Start agent** (⌘↵) opens a coding agent on it, in a new git worktree and space.

Link a space once from the cog: [Link a space](docs/guide.md#link-a-space), [Connect Jira](docs/connect-jira.md), [Connect Linear](docs/guide.md#connect-linear). More in [the guide](docs/guide.md#issues).

## Pull requests

![Pull requests: the grouped list and a pull request's page with Review with agent](herdr-ranch-prs/preview.png)

The space's pull requests, grouped by what each one waits on: review requested, yours to fix, ready to merge. A page per pull request with checks, files and a merge box. **Review with agent** checks it out, builds, tests and reports, without writing to GitHub.

More in [the guide](docs/guide.md#pull-requests).

## Reviews

![Reviews: a document with comments beside it](herdr-ranch-reviews/preview.png)

Comment on a Markdown file or on your agent's last answer, inside Herdr, and send the comments back to the agent. In Claude Code, `/herdr-ranch-annotate <file>` or `/herdr-ranch-last` opens the review beside the agent: click a block to comment, paste a screenshot, give a 👍, then **Send** (⌘⇧↵). The agent gets the same feedback text [Plannotator](https://plannotator.ai) gives, so it replaces `plannotator annotate` and `plannotator last` without a browser. The list shows what waits on you, in this space or all.

More in [the guide](docs/guide.md#reviews).

## The mod-buttons layout

![mod-buttons: a tab-bar button for every mod that wants one](mod-buttons/preview.png)

Herdr's own layout, with a tab-bar button for every installed mod that declares one. It works for any mod, not only these. To add a button to your own mod, see [mod-buttons/RECIPE.md](mod-buttons/RECIPE.md). [herdrdev/herdr-app#246](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr-app/issues/246) asks for this in Herdr itself.

## What it touches

- **Read only.** Nothing is written to Jira, Linear or GitHub. Start agent creates a local worktree and branch, and pushes nothing.
- **Tokens** go to your system's credential store, never into Herdr's settings.

Every program, host and file it uses: [docs/reference.md](docs/reference.md#what-they-run-and-store).

## Recommended

Mods by others that go well with Herdr Ranch. Install them the way their own README says; the mod-buttons layout gives each a button, even when its `mod.json` declares none.

### Automations

[DnzzL/herdr-automations](https://github.com/DnzzL/herdr-automations) (MIT): agent prompts on a schedule, such as a morning triage or a nightly dependency check. A run opens as a space in the app. Follow its section "In the Herdr desktop app"; you can skip its layout step, the mod-buttons layout adds its button.
